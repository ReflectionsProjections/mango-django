<h3>Bullseye: Your First Dart App</h3>
<h4>Saturday, 10/6 @ 6:30</h4>
<h4>2405 Siebel</h4>
<p>
Build your first Dart app! We'll lead you through the process of building a modern web app with the Dart platform, using both client-side and server-side Dart. You will explore the language, libraries, editor, and integration with Chromium. You'll leave this session with a working Dart app that works in modern browsers. Note that for this workshop you will need to have 
<a href='http://www.dartlang.org/downloads.html'>DART Editor</a> installed on your computer. Please make sure you have it downloaded installed before attending the code lab.

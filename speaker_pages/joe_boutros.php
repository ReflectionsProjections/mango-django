<p>
What is product prototyping? Why do we do it? How is it different from software engineering? In the startup world, we often find ourselves building a product and defining requirements for that product at the same time. Done properly, this allows you to anticipate and adapt to changing needs and requirements while building something truly awesome. Done poorly, you end up with wasted time, missed deadlines, and a steaming mess of unmaintainable code. In this talk, Boutros will share the philosophy and best practices that he's built up over the years and put into use every day working in the startup world.

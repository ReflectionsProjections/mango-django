Radu B. Rusu is the President and CEO of Open Perception, Inc., and a Visiting Lecturer at Stanford University. Before Open Perception, Rusu was a Research Scientist at Willow Garage, where he created the Point Cloud Library (PCL) project. Rusu received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Technische Universitaet Muenchen (TUM), Germany in 2009 with summa cum laude. During his Ph.D., Rusu was affiliated with the CoTeSys (Cognition for Technical Systems) excellence cluster at TUM, the AIC (Artificial Intelligence Center) at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) as an International Fellow Researcher, and Willow Garage, working on 3D semantic mapping techniques for mobile robots. Rusu has been on the boards of many workshops and scientific events in the field, held at prestigious conferences such as: RSS, ICRA, IROS, ECCV, ICCV, AAAI, etc. He has co-authored over 70 peer-reviewed scientific publications, including 1 book (+1 pending), a best paper award (ICAR 2009), and a best student paper award finalist (RSS 2011). His doctoral dissertation has also been awarded second place in the EURON Georges Giralt 2011 PhD Award out of 31 other excellent submissions. Rusu is a senior IEEE member, and besides many events that he co-organized, he was also the general chair of the IEEE ARSO 2011 conference.

Mankind has always been fascinated by the study of geometry and 3D shapes. Greek mathematicians formed the basis of modern geometry using inspirations from Babylonian and Egyptian discoveries, and their axioms started a revolution that led to a better understanding of many physical phenomena. Among many of the fields that profited from these developments was astronomy, the evolution of which fundamentally transformed society and culture. For instance, understanding the motion of planets and mapping them led to advances in navigation, which led to economical and social progress.

Fast forwarding to the 20th century, robotics have flourished from an idea to an existential part of our society. Coping with high volumes of products, in order to keep pace with the extremely large demand that we consume, would be unthinkable without robots in our modern world. However, the robots of today are very much like the explorers of the pre-Greek era: due to their limitations in navigation, they are very inefficient, and their economical impact is only a fraction of what it could be if we were to make them cheaper and more flexible. It is thus the right time to devise new mapping theories that are essential for a \"post-robotic\" generation of robots that can localize, navigate, and manipulate more efficiently. Our new playground is not astronomy, but a virtual representation of the world obtained using precise sensing devices that sample 3D collections of points on every surface they touch. We call these collections, \"point clouds\", and the new \"science\" that acquires, interprets them, and extracts meaningful information from them, \"3D point cloud processing.\"

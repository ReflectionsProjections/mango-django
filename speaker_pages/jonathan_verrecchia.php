<p>
CSS has always been left behind in terms of engineering because of its lack of features as a language. Even very basic ones like variables, math, or mixins, arenâ€™t usable yet due to the slow W3C standardization. But when it comes to writing large-scale CSS, the need for keeping CSS files maintainable becomes stronger and leads to new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. OOCSS and pre-processors like Sass are two recent and brilliant techniques that make CSS development much smarter. During his talk, Verrecchia will explain how they both work and how to combine them together to get the best of both worlds.

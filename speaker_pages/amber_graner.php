In this talk, Amber Graner will look at how applying Open Source philosophies she learned through her own contribution experience to everyday life has helped her become a stronger, more confident, and successful person in all areas of her personal, professional, and project life. Amber will share some of the most intimate moments of her Open Source, and especially Ubuntu, experiences to overcome some of her greatest fears, and will challenge the audience to to overcome their's as well. Amber will look at being open and transparent--what does meritocracy mean? Failure isn't failure, and more with her Southern wit and humor, she will challenge you to adopt these principles and become a better and more confident you.

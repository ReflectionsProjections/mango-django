				<h2>The pitch</h2>
				<p>
				Want to contribute to open source projects, but not sure where to start or
				what tools to use? Attend Shauna Gordon-McKeon's talk on Saturday, then come
				to our workshop on Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>On Sunday, October 7, we're running a four-hour workshop
				where we'll mentor you through your first (or your next) open source contribution.
				We can help you join big projects like WordPress, niche ones like Biopython,
				and everything in between.
				And if you want some hands-on time with git and the command line first, come
				to our workshops, also on Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>It's free! But if you want lunch,
				<strong>you have to sign up</strong>.

				<h2>Who should come?</h2>
				<p>
				Newcomers and experienced contributors alike. For newcomers to open source, come and learn what it's like to submit your
				first patch to an open source project. Experienced contributors, come to program in a supportive space and build an
				atmosphere of collaboration.
				</p>
				<h3>Mentorship, not competition</h3>
				<p>
				The event is run by OpenHatch, an educational non-profit that wants to see more
				students participating in open source communities. To that end, experienced
				programmers, system administrators, and open source contributors will be on hand
				to help you through your first contribution.
				</p>
				<h3>Optional tutorials</h3>
				<p>
				If you want to learn <tt>git</tt> or come to a tutorial on the basics of the
				command line, we'll be happy to teach you on Sunday morning through hands-on
				exercises.

				<h2>What you need to know</h2>
				<p>
				It helps you if you are reasonably familiar with one programming
				language: C, Python, C++, Ruby, or so forth. The open source projects
				we'll be using as examples will have tasks available ranging from
				simple documentation fixes where no code editing is needed, to small
				code changes, to adding unit tests, up to reviewing others' patches.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you let us know in the sign-up form what you know, we'll work to
				prepare tasks appropriate for you!

				<h2>What you don't need to know</h2>
				<p>
				You don't have to know how <tt>git</tt> works, or even how to use
				the command line. (Come to our tutorials &mdash; keep reading!)
				You don't even really have to know yet what open source is; just
				be sure to go to Shauna Gordon-McKeon's talk to learn more.
